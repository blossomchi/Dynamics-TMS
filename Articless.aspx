        Engr Sinebe, who was represented by the Director, Inspectorate of the Ministry, Mr Ichide Solomon enjoined the students to channel their energies towards their studies.

        He then charged them to eschew cultism and other vices that will mar not only their image but that of the Academy as well as truncate the pursuit of their life goals. He then went on to laud the Management of Rolof Academy for the promotion of ICT Education in the State.</p>
                    <p>

        Addressing the students and guests at the ceremony, the Chairman of the Governing Council of the Academy, Mr. Lucky Ofuafor, said that the vision of the Academy is to produce graduates who are ICT experts capable of proferring solutions to societal problems.               

        In her address, the Rector of the Academy, Mrs. Josephine Ofuafor, said that Rolof Computer Academy was licensed by the Federal Ministry of Education and the National Board for Technical Education, NBTE to operate as an Innovation Enterprise Institution, 
        IEI with effect from 27th August, 2017 and have been approved by JAMB to admit students through the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).

        She further disclosed that the Federal Ministry of Education and the NBTE approved 4 programmes for the award of National Innovation Diploma (NID) in Computer Hardware Engineering Technology, Computer Software Engineering,
        Multimedia Technology, Networking and System Security and a National Vocational Certificate (NVC) in Computer Studies.</p>
                    <p>

        The Rector said that the National Innovation Diploma that will be awarded to the students on graduation will qualify them for direct entry into 200level admission in the University, Higher National Diploma in Polytechnics or Higher National Innovation Diploma (HNID) in NBTE accredited IEI's.
         She then stressed the need for the Students to shun any deviant behaviour that will and acts of misconduct such as cybercrime that will expose them to danger and disrupt their academic programme.</p>


<p>
        Responding on behalf of the Matriculating Students, Mr. Humphrey Ohaneju, thanked the Management of Rolof Academy and said that they will abide by their Matriculation Oath to be Obedient and respect all in authority and be of good conduct throughout their stay at the Academy.

Digital Technology has created problem for those seeking admission to read courses not related to Digital Technology.  The job openings are no longer there.
Fewer hands are now needed.
Only those that have skills in digital technology will be able to secure employment in the immediate future.
Operations of government ministries, departments and agencies are now being computerized.  The days of manual jobs of carrying files are over.
Private companies are now computerizing their operations.
Mobile apps have now taken over most daily activities.  You can develop yours to make money for you while you are asleep.
